# FastAPI Service Foundation - Implementation Summary

## üéâ Successfully Completed Task 11: FastAPI Service Foundation

### ‚úÖ **What Was Implemented**

**1. FastAPI Application Structure with Configuration Management**
- Created `src/api/config.py` with comprehensive `APIConfig` and `ModelConfig` classes
- Environment-based configuration with Pydantic validation
- Support for API, MLflow, database, monitoring, and performance settings
- Structured logging setup with JSON format support

**2. Health Check Endpoints with System Status and Model Availability**
- Implemented `src/api/health.py` with multiple health check endpoints:
  - `GET /health/` - Basic health status
  - `GET /health/detailed` - Comprehensive system information
  - `GET /health/model` - Model status and performance
  - `GET /health/system` - System resource information
  - `GET /health/gpu` - GPU information and metrics
  - `POST /health/model/reload` - Model reload functionality

**3. Model Loading Utilities with MLflow Model Registry Integration**
- Created `src/api/model_loader.py` with comprehensive model loading:
  - Direct MLflow Model Registry integration
  - Model caching with TTL support for performance
  - Fallback mechanisms across multiple model stages
  - Model validation against performance thresholds
  - Thread-safe operations with proper locking

**4. Prometheus Metrics Integration for API Monitoring**
- Implemented `src/api/metrics.py` with extensive metrics collection:
  - API request metrics (count, duration, status codes)
  - Prediction metrics (count, duration, value distribution)
  - GPU metrics (utilization, memory, temperature, power)
  - System metrics (errors, database operations, model status)
  - Background monitoring with configurable intervals

**5. Structured Logging for All API Operations**
- Comprehensive logging throughout all components
- JSON structured logging with configurable format
- Request/response logging middleware
- Error tracking with detailed context
