```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main

# If you encounter issues with large files or need to force push (use carefully)
# git push -u origin main --force
```

### Step 5: Verify Push Success

```bash
# Check remote status
git status

# Verify all files are pushed
git ls-remote origin

# Check GitHub repository in browser
# https://github.com/your-username/mlops-california-housing
```

## üîß Post-Push Configuration

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Repository Settings

1. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
   - Select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
   - Set workflow permissions to "Read and write permissions"

2. **Configure Branch Protection**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"

3. **Set up GitHub Environments**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environments**
   - Create `staging` environment (no protection rules)
   - Create `production` environment with required reviewers

### Step 2: Configure Secrets (Optional for Full CI/CD)

Add these secrets in **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**:

```bash
# Docker Registry (optional)
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN=your-dockerhub-token

# Deployment Servers (optional)
STAGING_HOST=staging.yourdomain.com
STAGING_USER=ubuntu
STAGING_SSH_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...
PROD_HOST=production.yourdomain.com
PROD_USER=ubuntu
PROD_SSH_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...

# Notifications (optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

### Step 3: Test GitHub Actions

1. **Trigger CI Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Create a test branch and PR
   git checkout -b test-ci-pipeline
   echo "# Test CI" >> TEST_CI.md
   git add TEST_CI.md
   git commit -m "test: trigger CI pipeline"
   git push origin test-ci-pipeline
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**
   - Go to GitHub and create PR from `test-ci-pipeline` to `main`
   - Watch the PR checks workflow execute
   - Verify all checks pass

3. **Test Docker Build**
   ```bash
   # Merge PR to trigger Docker build
   git checkout main
   git merge test-ci-pipeline
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Monitor Workflows**
   - Go to **Actions** tab in repository
   - Monitor workflow execution and logs
   - Verify successful completion

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Large File Errors

```bash
# Check for large files
find . -type f -size +50M

# Use Git LFS for large files (if needed)
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.model"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add Git LFS tracking"
```

### Issue 2: Workflow Validation Errors

```bash
# Fix workflow syntax errors
python scripts/validate-workflows.py

# Check specific workflow
yamllint .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Issue 3: Permission Errors

```bash
# Check repository permissions
# Go to Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
# Ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected
```

### Issue 4: Secret Configuration

```bash
# Verify secrets are properly set
# Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
# Check that all required secrets are configured
```
