# Model Comparison and Selection System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 10 has been successfully completed. The Model Comparison and Selection System provides comprehensive automated model comparison across all 5 trained models with cross-validation, statistical significance testing, and automated best model selection.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automated Model Comparison
- **Multi-model support**: Compares all 5 GPU-accelerated models (cuML Linear Regression, cuML Random Forest, XGBoost, PyTorch Neural Network, LightGBM)
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Evaluates models on training, validation, and test sets
- **Performance metrics**: Calculates RMSE, MAE, and R² scores for all models

### 2. Cross-Validation and Statistical Testing
- **K-fold cross-validation**: Configurable number of folds (3-10) with proper error estimation
- **Statistical significance testing**: Pairwise comparisons between models with p-value calculations
- **Robust evaluation**: Handles different model types with appropriate prediction interfaces

### 3. Multi-Criteria Model Selection
- **Weighted scoring system**: Configurable weights for different metrics (RMSE, MAE, R², training time)
- **Composite scoring**: Combines multiple criteria into a single selection score
- **Flexible criteria**: Support for both minimization (RMSE, MAE) and maximization (R²) metrics

### 4. MLflow Model Registry Integration
- **Best model registration**: Automatically registers the selected best model in MLflow Model Registry
- **Model versioning**: Proper versioning and staging (Staging → Production)
- **Metadata tagging**: Adds selection criteria and performance metadata as model tags

### 5. Comprehensive Visualization and Reporting
- **Performance comparison plots**: Bar charts comparing all models across different metrics
- **Cross-validation results**: Error bar plots showing CV performance with confidence intervals
- **Training characteristics**: Scatter plots showing training time vs performance trade-offs
- **Model selection summary**: Composite score visualization and selection criteria breakdown

### 6. Data Export and Reporting
- **JSON export**: Detailed comparison results with all metrics and metadata
- **CSV export**: Tabular summary for easy analysis in spreadsheet applications
- **HTML reports**: Professional-looking reports with tables and summaries
- **Plot generation**: High-quality PNG plots saved to plots/ directory
